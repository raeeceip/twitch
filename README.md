# Twitch Streamer

This project is a Go-based application for capturing screen content and streaming it to Twitch.

## Architecture

The application is designed with the following components:

1. **Screen Capture Module**: Captures raw frames from the screen.
2. **Audio Capture Module**: Captures raw audio from the system or microphone.
3. **Video Encoder**: Encodes raw video frames into a compressed format (e.g., H.264).
4. **Audio Encoder**: Encodes raw audio into a compressed format (e.g., AAC).
5. **RTMP Packager**: Packages encoded video and audio into RTMP format for streaming.
6. **Configuration Manager**: Manages application settings and configuration.
7. **User Interface**: Provides user controls for the streaming process.
8. **Stream Controller**: Coordinates the streaming process based on user input.
9. **Twitch API Client**: Interacts with Twitch API for stream key and other information.
10. **Error Handler and Logging System**: Manages error handling and logging.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to download dependencies.
4. Implement the functionality in each module according to the architecture.
5. Build the application using `go build ./cmd/twitch-streamer`.
6. Run the resulting executable to start the Twitch streamer.

## Configuration

Before running the streamer, you'll need to set up your Twitch API credentials and stream key. These should be managed securely, preferably through environment variables or a secure configuration file.
